# Coursea Bioinfomatics course

Contains my code for the two courses on Coursera

[Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis)
[Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genome-sequencing)

These codes are correct at the time of writing (or pushing).

If they fail to run, it's probably due to a malformed input data.
